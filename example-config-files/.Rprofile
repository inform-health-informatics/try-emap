# Example .Rprofile file
# Created 2020-04-29


# .Rprofile: save this file in your Documents folder 
# the documents folder is visible from a terminal in a number of different places
# depending on your terminal and your drive mapping
#
# e.g.
# MobaXterm
# /home/USER/MyDocuments
# Git Bash
# /e/UserProfiles/USER
# R terminal
# //UCLCMDDPRAFSS21/Home/USER/Documents

# obviously replace USER with your username and 
# similarly the drive (e) or the network share (UCLCMDDPRAFSS21)

# You can get the path your Documents folder (HOME) in R using
# Sys.getenv('HOME')


message("Welcome ...")

# `local` creates a new, empty environment
