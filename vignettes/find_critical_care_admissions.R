# - work to define department at the functional rather than the ward level
# i.e. P03 and T03 are both critical care
# - plot LoS over time using R plotly



# Calculate the severity of illness models for critical care

# Part 1: Identify critical care admissions
# Part 2: define the outcome
# Part 3: define the admitting physiology

# Part 1 of 3: Identify critical care admissions

# Let's calculate the ICNARC acute physiology score for patients admitted to the
# ICU, and then plot this against their outcome First we need to identify
# patients admitted to a critical care area (easy-ish) Then we need to define
# the beginning of their admission. This is harder because they move between
# critical care areas, and because they may be readmitted.

# We have 2 databases
# 'star'  : live (within minutes), complete, with the history of all information but in a 'star' schema so harder to use
# 'ops'   : based on the OMOP schema, and up-to-date within 12-24 hours; patient centric, easier to use

# A series of pre-built views are available on 'star' that make it easier to use
# - bed_moves: patient movements from bed to bed within the bed
# - demographics: direct patient identifiers including vital status and date of death
# - flowsheets: derived from both flowsheet via caboodle and via HL7 where the interfaces have been built (e.g. vital signs) 
# - labs: derived from the HL7 stream from HSL

# We have copies of the queries that create these views stores in snippets/SQL
# You can load these as follows if you wish e.g.
# query <- read_file("snippets/SQL/bed_moves.sql")
